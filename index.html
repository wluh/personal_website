                    I'm passionate about education and volunteer with Microsoft TEALS to bring computer science classes to schools who otherwise wouldn't offer them. Previously, I taught public speaking skills at The Harker School in Saratoga, CA. When I'm not coding, find me listening to and playing music, hiking, or designing for fun.
