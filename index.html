                Hi! I'm a student at <span style='color: rgb(92,6,140)'>NYU CIMS</span>.<br>
                Currently, I'm majoring in Computer Science and planning to minor in Data Science.
            </h3>
            <p>
                Some of my on campus activities include being the Principal Violist at the NYU Orchestra, and being a part of the Social Media Team of the NYU Steinhardt Music Dept. <br> <br>
                I'm passionate about education and volunteer with Microsoft TEALS to bring Computer Science classes to schools who otherwise wouldn't offer them. Previously, I taught public speaking skills at The Harker School in Saratoga, CA. When I'm not coding, find me listening to and playing music (I'm a violist!), hiking, or designing for fun.

                    <h3>Software Engineering Intern at Singularity.AI (Summer 2020 - FT)</h3>
                    Tested the efficacy and potentiality of SSD and R-CNN computer vision frameworks in a variety of environments. In particular, I tested inception-v3 on a variety of datasets, adjusting parameters to maximize performance in order to determine its suitability for use in a clinical setting, and developed a image processing solution to optimize the raw data for the network, and quickly produce data visualizations for the end user.
